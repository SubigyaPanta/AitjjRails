<h1>Planning</h1>

<h3>What will people be able learn about in the community that you’re building? Alternatively,
  if you are automating some collaborative workflow, what work will people accomplish with
  your sytem?</h3>
<p>People will be able to view different products and can compare its price with other product price of same category and buy them.People can also sell their own products</p>
<h3>What do you want people to say about your service after a visit?</h3>
<p>The website provides all the people in AIT with multiple options regarding the product they desire to purchase.
  People can also negotiate the product price. </p>
<h3>What are the relevant distinct user classes?</h3>
<p>Users : who can buy or sell products</p>
<p>Administrators: administrates the platform</p>
<h3>What should a user on a smartphone be able to do?</h3>
<p>Smartphone specific functionality implementation is not being considered currently.The developed website can be accessed through the browser in smartphone.
</p>
<h3>Build two or three profiles for users of your application. A profile page contains the following
  information: (a) a picture of the user, (b) the user’s name, age, occupation, marital status,
  housing situation, and income, (c) the user’s short-term and long-term goals relevant to the
  online community that you’re building, (d) the immediate questions that this user will bring to
  the site, (e) the kind of computer equipment and connection in this person’s house, and (f) any
  other information that will help to humanize this fictitious person. See the sample plan on the
  course Web page for examples.</h3>
<p>User Profiles </p>
<%= link_to 'Akhil Chennu', ps_three_planning_akhil_path%>
<br>
<%= link_to 'Sainath reddy', ps_three_planning_sainath_path%>
<br>
<%= link_to 'Rajesh Ve', ps_three_planning_rajesh_path%>

<h3>For each class of user identified in Exercise 1a, produce a textual or graphical usage scenario for
  how that user will experience your service.</h3>
<p>Scenario:
  The user has to sign up with the required credentials and view the products of different categories.The users can buy and sell products easily.The user who wants to sell a product has to upload the picture of the product with description of product such as price,number of days product has been used,condition of the product and contact details.The user who wants to buy the product can compare the description of the product with other in the same category and can select the one  between many products.after selection , the user can contact the seller with the provided contact details.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Evaluate offline alternatives. You ought to have a good reason for building an information system.
  You need a convincing answer for why we need this system rather than a book, a pencil, and paper.
  Explain the available alternatives and explain the best features of these alternatives. Justify why
  your system is necessary.</h3>
<p>The main  reason for building this system is there is no proper well maintained system for people in AIT to buy and sell products.People in AIT have to communicate in between them to sell and buy products.In this case many people prooducts will be left out and people who need a product can’t know that is is available in the university due to lack of information and this person who needs it faces a problem.
</p>

<h3>Evaluate online alternatives. Find the best existing online communities in your subject area.
  Note how closely they conform to the six elements of sustainability (magnet content, collabora-
  tion, searching and browsing capabilities, delegated moderation, means of removing bozos, and
  means for extending the community. Also write down anything strikingly good or bad about the
  registration process and the mechanisms of collaboration, e.g., in discussion forums, comments on
  articles, and chat rooms. Look for voice and mobile interfaces. If present, try them out. Look for
  evidence of personalization and direct controls over preferences.</h3>
There is an online alternative. It is a facebook group where students post goods/products that they want to sell. Normally they sell things before leaving the college or something they bought and later got no use of it.

Now, considering the six elements of sustainability:<br>
<p>
Magnet Content: Buyers have difficulty finding the right product they want to buy and sellers struggle to find the right buyer. We aim to solve this problem. Thus we get the users (students in ait) that are facing this problem (difficulty in selling their belongings like used books etc.) on daily basis.
</p>
<p>
Collaboration: Here students are both buyers and sellers. Hence, there will be a kind of community where students will be helping each others. For example, by buying second hand items, buyers get items in low price while seller get some salvage value.
</p>
<p>
Searching and Browsing Capability: Our website will have various filters that will help users to search and browse for their desired products easily.
</p>
<p>
Delegated Moderation: We can add user roles administrator and regular members. Administrators are supposed to look out for bad behaviour.
</p>
<p>
Removing bozos: There are bad/annoying people everywhere. There will be a method to ban users that misbehave with others and/or post spams.
</p>

<h3>Identify where the magnet content for your system is going to come from.</h3>
<p>
The magnet content will come from the users.
</p>
<h3>Decide on hostname and figure out DNS registration procedures. Be sure to look into the options
  for hosting of your web site. Ideally, you should all have a real hostname for your system, pointing
  to your CSIM server, by the end of the semester. At the end of the semester, you should also be
  ready to place your site at a more permanent home. Please include a plan for how you will do
  this. Note that AIT, CSIM, or AIT SU could probably be pursuaded to host some of your groups’
  sites. Others would be more appropriately hosted offsite.</h3>
<p>
We’re thinking the hostname should be www.sastokart.com  (just a name I came up with). I was thinking about getting a free rails server like that by heroku
</p>
<h3>Describe the intellectual property rights of you as developers, authors as contributors, and so on.</h3>
<p>
I think it should have a copyright
